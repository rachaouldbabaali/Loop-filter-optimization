# Loop-filter-optimization
Our project aims to build a dummy business intelligence dashboard that provides a filter functionality and displays data based on the selected filters. The motivation behind this project is to create a user-friendly dashboard that allows users to filter data based on their preferences, similar to how filters work on e-commerce websites like Amazon.
